# Add a declarative step here for populating the DB with movies.

Given /the following movies exist/ do |movies_table|
  movies_table.hashes.each do |movie|
    Movie.create(movie)
  end
  # fail "Unimplemented"
end

Then /(.*) seed movies should exist/ do | n_seeds |
  Movie.count.should be n_seeds.to_i
end

# Make sure that one string (regexp) occurs before or after another one
#   on the same page

Then /I should see "(.*)" before "(.*)"/ do |e1, e2|
  #  ensure that that e1 occurs before e2.
  #  page.body is the entire content of the page as a string.
  fail "Unimplemented"
end

# Make it easier to express checking or unchecking several boxes at once
#  "When I uncheck the following ratings: PG, G, R"
#  "When I check the following ratings: G"

When /I (un)?check the following ratings: (.*)/ do |uncheck, rating_list|
  rating_list = rating_list.split(", ")
  rating_list.each do |rating|
    step %{I #{uncheck}check "ratings[#{rating}]"}
  end
end

Then /I should see all the movies/ do
  input.('#ratings[G]').should be_checked
  # page.all('#ratings[G]').should be_checked
  rows = page.all("#movies tbody tr").count
  rows.should be Movie.count
end
